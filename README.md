# Obsidian Notes

Markdown files created while using Obsidian as a note-taking program. Generally, this includes notes from every "tech-related" thing I learn and/or need to remember: From basic git commands, to Rust's inner workings, and other specialized tools like puppet.

Its important to note that all the files present in here are meant to be opened using Obsidian. Thats why there may be a lot of words surrounded by double brackets: These are meant to be backlinks to other markdown files. This is a functionality exclusive to Obsidian. The regular markdown files however, can be opened and are readable inside of Github.
