## Notes

Eustache wants me to do two things

1. Link:
	- Go to access points, they are not connected. Its not online
	- This hotel needs to be provisioned
	- There are two NYCCI, CONRAD NEW YORK and the one he sent through the link. He wants me to move the switches from the CONRAD NEW YORK (guesttek managed) to the hilton one (NA-USA-NY...). They should have the correct configuration.
	- Dont touch 
2. Marelyn thingy
	- Store the device information
	- Store the switch port data
	- Need to have a specific login. Try to setup API access.
	-
