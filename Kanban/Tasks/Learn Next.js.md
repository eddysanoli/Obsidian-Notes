## Description

I was inspired by the guy from Upwork. Decided to build my portfolio using Next.js. That way I can learn Next.js while I also practice my React (and could be a step for going to React Native in the future)

Found [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P8mASSREYM&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwgC9mj0qv972IO5DmD-H0ZH&ab_channel=Codevolution) on Youtube and also the [docs](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs) seem to be pretty good.
