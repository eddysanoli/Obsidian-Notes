#  Create a systemd service for the terraria server
Created on: 2022-10-31

## Description

The terraria server right now requires me to go into the server and set it up automatically. I want to link it to the discord bot so that it's easier to take up and down, however, right now the bot can only very specifically start and stop a minecraft server. I want to create a `systemd` service so that the entire server can start up by just starting or stopping the service

Found this Linode [article](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/host-a-terraria-server-on-your-linode/) that included the setup for a systemd service. Also here is the [Terraria Wiki](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Server) on how to setup a Terraria server.
