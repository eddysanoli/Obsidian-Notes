# Link Bot with Gaming Server
Created on: 2022-10-31

## Description

The discord bot got disconnected from the gaming server since I made a major overhaul to the server infrastructure. I want to link it back up after completing the required changes

## Tasks

- [ ] Complete: [[Create a systemd service for the terraria server]] 
- [ ] Complete: [[Refactor Bot Code]] 
- [ ]

## Notes

[[2022-10-31]]
I just need to make it so that the `ssh2` package from the bot, can call the `systemd` service remotely. This will also allow me to stop or restart the service automatically and without much pain
